\usage{
LowCoverageMethRateDistribution(
  LowCoverage,
  LowCoverage_samples,
  HighCoverage,
  HighCoverage_samples,
  bins = 50,
  returnDF = FALSE,
  returnPlot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LowCoverage}{Single GRanges object as returned by CallContextMethylation function to inspect. The object can also contain cytosines from multiple contexts}

\item{LowCoverage_samples}{Samples to use from the LowCoverage object. Either a string or a vector (for multiple samples).}

\item{HighCoverage}{Single GRanges object as returned by CallContextMethylation function to inspect. The object can also contain cytosines from multiple contexts.}

\item{HighCoverage_samples}{Single sample to use from HighCoverage. String}

\item{bins}{The number of bins for which to calculate the "binned" methylation rate. Defaults to 50}

\item{returnDF}{Whether to return the data.frame used for plotting. Defaults to FALSE}

\item{returnPlot}{Whether to return the plot. Defaults to TRUE}
}
\description{
Monitor methylation rate distribution in a low coverage samples as compared to a high coverage "reference" one.
It bins cytosines with similar methylation rates (as observed in the HighCoverage sample) into bins. A single
methylation rate value is computed for each bin

#                                 HighCoverage_samples = HighCoverage_samples[1],
#                                 returnDF = FALSE,
#                                 returnPlot = TRUE)
